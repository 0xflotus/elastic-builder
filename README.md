# elastic-builder (WIP)
A Node.js implementation of the elasticsearch Query DSL

## Synopsis
A Node.js implementation of the [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) DSL for use with the [official elasticsearch javascript client](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html).

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation
> A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

Port of `elastic.js` to es6 with elasticsearch 5.3 compatibility.

## Installation
Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors
Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## Credits
`elastic-builder` is heavily inspired by [`elastic.js`](https://github.com/fullscale/elastic.js)
and the [fork](https://github.com/ErwanPigneul/elastic.js) by Erwan Pigneul.
